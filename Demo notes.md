# The demonstration went really well! Here's some notes that the counselors and Ms. Whatcott said we could do with the website

- Display conflicting periods
- - This is done I think? I will test
- Update the website often so it matches the master schedule (like once a week or so)
- - This is hard too but it can be done easier than Skyward communications
- Communicate with Skyward to see which classes are full and which ones aren't
- - This is hard
- Add teachers to the list
- - If this is referring to the outputed schedules on the website, I'll get right on that.
- Possibly add TA and release time periods
- - This is hard and confusing
- Allow blank spots on the schedule (in case someone doesn't want to take 8 classes that year)
- - If this is referring to the schedule for choosing classes, you don't need to enter 8 options.
- Option for a day preference (example: a student would prefer to take math on A day instead of B day)
- - This is easy and can be done before the year is out

  Mr. Lee wants to try and get two of the comments done this year: display conflicting periods and updating the master schedule often. Mr. Lee said we could either do
  the updates automatically or manually. I'll leave that up to Aaron since he's working with the back-end data. We could also try and allow blank spots this year as well, but
  we don't have to do it right now.

  Overall, the demonstration went really well! A lot of counselors came in to see the website, and they all loved it. They also think that student will like this tool
  as well when people start using it.
